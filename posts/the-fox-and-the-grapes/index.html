The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox&rsquo;s mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.</p><p>The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.</p><p>Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.</p><p>&ldquo;What a fool I am,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for.&rdquo;</p><p>And off he walked very, very scornfully.</p><p>Moral of the story:</p><blockquote><p>There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach.</p></blockquote></section></div></div></main><footer class="bg-dark text-light"><div class="container py-5"><div class="row justify-content-end text-right"><div class=col-md-2><a href=/privacy-policy/>Privacy Policy</a></div><div class=col-md-2><a href=/imprint/>Imprint</a></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
